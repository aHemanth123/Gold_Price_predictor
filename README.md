Challenges Faced :
```
when i working on that the dates are missing so i filled up with before date

when i working on dates such there is no Jan 1 2024  , I need to fill it up using december 31 jan 2023 which is in next table

 Note: This works for months other than January. For January, you need to handle year change separately.  for calculation  previous month vs current trend  month
```
